### Build your own Cards

The process we followed was roughly along these lines:
* Start with a theme
* Setup a spreadsheet and have a page that can randomly select questions and answers for you. [Here is an example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QFiH8ynsOPugInRpVypb6ICkiEllaxt81o9kEE-PwWI/edit?usp=sharing)
* Use an existing deck for inspiration, you can use one of ours or the original [CardsAgainstHumanity](https://cardsagainsthumanity.com/)
  * We found it easier to start with question cards as the initial inspiration
  * Some question cards have universal appeal and adapt well to different deck themes, such as:
    * Why canâ€™t I sleep at night?
    * ______. It's a trap!
    * Why am I sticky?
    * etc.
  * Some cards just need subtle tweaking, such as:
    * What made my first _GitHub PR_ so awkward?
    * What is my _manager_ hiding from me?
    * When I am _DevOps team lead_, I will create ______.
    * etc.
  * Other cards simply give you inspiration to write something completely different!
  * As you're writing question cards, you'll likely start to get inspiration for answers too, make sure you write these down!
  * Again, many answers can be applied universally, such as:
    * Diversity
    * Robots
    * Inappropriate yodeling
    * Management incompetence
  * Some answers are very simple, and effective like that. Other answers make more sense as full sentences. This depends on your questions and style.
* Refine all the cards. Do this several times and try get a diverse team to review them. You want everyone to get some fun out of it!
* Testing using the spreadsheet can help make sure the various questions and answers make some sort of sense when combined

The advantage of setting up the spreadsheet is it's quicker and easier to check the combinations and refine the language and grammar. You'll find you end up with a few different types of questions, some that work well with simple one word answers, some that work well with full statements. You want to make sure there's a good balance between these. You can also add some adjectives to make the answers a little more absurd and so funny. For example instead of just "stupidity", enhance it with "unquestionable stupidity". Some answers simply don't go with some questions, don't worry, that's why the gameplay gives each player 10 cards and allows people to swap them!

Once you have a deck, export the questions and answers to 2 text files. Have each question/answer as a single line in each file. Create a branch of this repo, upload your deck files, and then give us a description of the deck in the Pull request. Completed decks will get added to [CardsAgainst.io](https://cardsagainst.io). We hope you have fun creating the decks, please feel free to reach out to any of us for any questions or advice.
